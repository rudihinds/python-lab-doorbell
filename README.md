# Doorbell Application - the TDD lab

This is the starting project for the TDD lab. Open it in PyCharm and work
through the provided instructions.

## Setup

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed (currently 3.7.1) from

From within the repository folder, please install the following in order to run
the project:

# install the dependencies from Pipfile:
pipenv install --dev
```

Pipenv "automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well
as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It
also generates the ever-important Pipfile.lock, which is used to produce
deterministic builds." [1](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
